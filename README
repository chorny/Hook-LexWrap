NAME
    Hook::LexWrap - Lexically scoped subroutine wrappers

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.23 of Hook::LexWrap.

DESCRIPTION
    Hook::LexWrap allows you to install a pre- or post-wrapper (or both)
    around an existing subroutine. Unlike other modules that provide this
    capacity (e.g. Hook::PreAndPost and Hook::WrapSub), Hook::LexWrap
    implements wrappers in such a way that the standard `caller' function
    works correctly within the wrapped subroutine.
